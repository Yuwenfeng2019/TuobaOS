# TuobaOS
A Customized Distribution for Embedded, IoT/Edge, Cloud/DataCenter, and so on. 

This is a developer friendly distribution that target at Embedded, IoT/Edge, Cloud/DataCenter, especially on Open Hardware Platforms.
It will be implementented in two stages:
1) in the first or current stage, the images that we provide will base on an existed distribution like Fedora, Debian, and so on; 
2) in the second stage, we will fully customize a new distribution according to our design goals (will be explained later) and setup 
   our own package repositories.
