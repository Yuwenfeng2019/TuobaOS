# TuobaOS
A Customized distribution for Embedded, IoT/Edge, Cloud/DataCenter, and so on. 

Developer friendly Linux distribution images that target at on Open Hardware development boards to achieve the following goals gradually:

Stage 1 
   1.1 base on an existed distribution like Fedora, Manjaro, and so on 
   1.2 upstreaming Linux Kernel with all the necessary HCI related features (e.g., eBPF, Virtualization, Debugging, Networking,     
        Storageâ€¦)enabled according to our design 
   1.3 all the necessary development required packages (such as that for programming language runtimes, developer toolkits, 
        virtualization softwares, devops utilities, HPC/AI frameworks, security tools, and so on) are preinstalled.
   ...

Stage 2
   Get rid of the old GNU softwares and corresponding dependencies as much as possible, such like: 
   2.1 remove GCC and use LLVM as the default toolchain to build everything like Linux Kernel
   2.2 replace glibc with musl libc (http://www.musl-libc.org/) upstreaming Linux Kernel with our own customization, 
       especially for eBPF related code, and an In-Kernel messaging bus
   ...
  
Stage 3
   3.1 replace musl libc with llvm-libc (https://llvm.org/docs/Proposals/LLVMLibC.html) if the later is mature enough 
   3.2 upstreaming Linux Kernel with all the In-Kernel services work as expected according to our design
